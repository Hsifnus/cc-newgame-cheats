# Install

This mod requires [CCLoader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader) which you can either install manually or use the [CCLoader installer](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/ccloader-installer).

Once you have CCLoader installed, plop the the downloaded folder into `CrossCode/assets/mods` to install it!
